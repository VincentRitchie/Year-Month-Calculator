# Year-Month-Calculator
This repository contains a simple Python program that calculates the number of days in a given month and year. The program also includes a function to check for leap years, ensuring accurate calculations for February in leap years.
Future Enhancements

1. User Interface:
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt to make the program more user-friendly.

2. Date Validation:
Add validation to ensure the user inputs a valid year and month.

3. Support for Different Calendars:
Extend the program to support different calendar systems (e.g., Julian calendar, Islamic calendar).

4. Detailed Leap Year Information:
Provide more detailed information about why a year is a leap year or not.

5. Full Date Range Input:
Allow users to input a full date range (start date and end date) and calculate the total number of days within that range.

6. Command-line Arguments:
Allow users to specify the year and month through command-line arguments instead of interactive prompts.

7. Day of the Week Calculation:
Implement functionality to calculate and display the day of the week for the first and last day of the specified month.

8. Output Formatting Options:
Provide options for different output formats (e.g., JSON, XML) for easier integration with other tools.
