## Future Enhancements

### 1. **User Interface**
   - **Description**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt to make the program more user-friendly.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances usability by providing a visual interface for users who prefer not to use the command line.

### 2. **Date Validation**
   - **Description**: Add validation to ensure the user inputs a valid year and month.
   - **Benefit**: Improves the robustness of the program by preventing invalid inputs that could cause errors.

### 3. **Support for Different Calendars**
   - **Description**: Extend the program to support different calendar systems (e.g., Julian calendar, Islamic calendar).
   - **Benefit**: Makes the program more versatile by accommodating various cultural and historical calendar systems.

### 4. **Detailed Leap Year Information**
   - **Description**: Provide more detailed information about why a year is a leap year or not.
   - **Benefit**: Educates users by explaining the leap year rules and the reasoning behind the program’s calculations.

### 5. **Full Date Range Input**
   - **Description**: Allow users to input a full date range (start date and end date) and calculate the total number of days within that range.
   - **Benefit**: Expands the program's functionality to handle more complex date calculations.

### 6. **Command-line Arguments**
   - **Description**: Allow users to specify the year and month through command-line arguments instead of interactive prompts.
   - **Benefit**: Streamlines the process for advanced users who prefer to automate the program with scripts or commands.

### 7. **Day of the Week Calculation**
   - **Description**: Implement functionality to calculate and display the day of the week for the first and last day of the specified month.
   - **Benefit**: Adds additional information that can be useful for planning or historical analysis.

### 8. **Output Formatting Options**
   - **Description**: Provide options for different output formats (e.g., JSON, XML) for easier integration with other tools.
   - **Benefit**: Increases the program's versatility by allowing integration with other software systems or formats.
